# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a desktop-based application developed using Python and Tkinter for the graphical interface, along with SQLite as the database. This application allows users (such as librarians or students) to manage a library by adding, issuing, returning, and deleting books. It also supports tracking the availability of books and calculating late return penalties.

The GUI provides an intuitive interface where users can perform operations such as searching for a book by title, issuing a book to a user with an issue date, returning it with an optional return date, and calculating the fine if the return is delayed beyond the grace period.
